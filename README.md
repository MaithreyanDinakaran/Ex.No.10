Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

### Name: Maithreyan D
### Reg No: 212222220021

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

**Test Case Scenario 1: Article on Climate Change**
First Draft (Simple Prompt):

Prompt: “Write a short article on climate change.”

Output – First Draft:

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns across the world. It is mainly caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial pollution. The effects include rising sea levels, heat waves, melting ice caps, and changing rainfall patterns. To reduce climate change, we need to adopt renewable energy, plant trees, reduce waste, and follow sustainable practices. Immediate action is essential to protect the planet for future generations.

Refined Draft Using Query Decomposition + Answer Engineering
Prompt:

“Break the article into:

Definition

Causes

Effects

Solutions
Write in a formal tone.”

Output – Version 2:

**1. Definition:**
Climate change is the long-term alteration of global climate patterns, primarily observed through increased temperatures.

**2. Causes:**
Major contributors include greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, large-scale deforestation, and industrial processes.

**3. Effects:**
It leads to extreme weather events, glacier melting, sea-level rise, reduced biodiversity, and disruptions in agriculture.

**4. Solutions:**
Mitigation requires transitioning to renewable energy, enforcing conservation policies, supporting afforestation, and encouraging low-carbon lifestyles.

Decision-Making Prompt Version
Prompt:

“Choose one tone:
A) Highly formal
B) Informative and simple
C) Urgent and persuasive
Write the article in the chosen tone.”

Output – Version 3 (Model Selected Tone B):
Climate change is a serious global challenge caused mainly by human activities like burning coal, oil, and cutting down forests. These actions release greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. As a result, we experience more heat waves, unpredictable rainfall, and rising sea levels. To slow down climate change, we must shift to clean energy, protect forests, and use resources responsibly. Small actions by individuals and strong policies by governments together can make a big impact.

Final Polished Article (Semantic Filtering + Tail Generation)
Prompt:

“Rewrite the article with:

Clear structure

Smooth flow

Simple language

Positive and action-oriented tone

Add a short concluding tail.”

**Final Output:**

Climate change refers to the gradual warming of the Earth due to increased greenhouse gases. Human activities like burning fossil fuels and clearing forests accelerate this process. Its effects are visible in rising sea levels, stronger storms, droughts, and melting ice caps.
To overcome this challenge, we must adopt renewable energy sources, protect forests, reduce plastic waste, and use energy efficiently. Every individual action contributes to a safer planet.
Together, we can slow down climate change and build a cleaner, healthier future.

**Test Case Scenario 2: Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story**
First Draft (Simple Prompt):

Prompt: “Write a short sci-fi story.”

Output – First Draft:

In the year 2150, humans lived on floating cities because Earth’s surface had become unstable. A young explorer named Mira discovered an ancient device that could restore the planet. She activated it, and slowly the land began to heal. Humanity returned to Earth to rebuild their world with hope and unity.

Refined Draft Using Tail Generation + Answer Engineering
Prompt:

“Rewrite the story with:

Character introduction

Conflict

Twist

Resolution

120–150 words.”

Output – Version 2:

In 2150, Earth’s surface was toxic, and people lived in floating cities. Mira, a 17-year-old apprentice engineer, dreamed of restoring the planet. While exploring abandoned ruins, she found a glowing device labeled “Terraformer Prototype.”
But activating it triggered a defense drone that believed humans were the threat. Mira cleverly reprogrammed the drone using her engineering skills. Once the device was activated, clouds thickened, rain returned, and the soil regained life.
The floating cities slowly descended as Earth began to heal. Mira became a symbol of courage and renewal.

Decision-Making Prompt Version
Prompt:

“Choose the story style:

Fast-paced adventure

Emotional and inspiring

Mystery-based
Write the story in the chosen style.”

Output – Version 3 (Model Selected Option 2):
Mira always felt a connection to Earth, even though she had never set foot on its soil. When she discovered the ancient Terraformer, she felt hope for the first time. With determination and a few tears of fear and excitement, she restored life to a dying world. Her courage reminded humanity that even in darkness, hope can regenerate entire planets.

Final Polished Version (Semantic Filtering + Creativity Enhancement)
Prompt:

“Produce a final polished sci-fi short story with:

Emotional depth

Clear setting

Smooth narration

Optimistic ending

150 words.”

Final Output:

In 2150, humanity drifted in floating cities above a lifeless Earth. Mira, a young engineer with a stubborn belief in second chances, spent her days studying fragments of forgotten technology. During one expedition, she uncovered a small sphere pulsing with a steady blue light—the last functioning Terraformer.
As she activated it, thick clouds formed, releasing the first rainfall Earth had seen in a century. The brown dust below transformed into patches of green. People watched in disbelief as their lost home awakened.
Mira stood at the edge of the sky deck, smiling as the floating cities slowly descended.
For the first time in generations, humanity felt the promise of a new beginning.
